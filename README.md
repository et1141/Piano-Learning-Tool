The project involves the practical part of my final bachelor thesis, where I created a tool to help with learning to play the piano. The main objective of the project is to convert an audio file into a MIDI file. The goal is to build and train my own model (possibly inspired by the Transkun model) while also providing the option to use other existing models, like Spotifyâ€™s Basic Pitch.

# Piano Learning Tool â€” Setup Guide


## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/et1141/piano-audio-to-midi
cd piano-audio-to-midi
```

## Install pyenv (macOS)
```bash
brew install pyenv
```

## Configure pyenv in shell
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Reload terminal
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Install Python 3.10
```bash
pyenv install 3.10.13
```

## Set local Python version
```bash
pyenv local 3.10.13
```

## Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv piano-env
source piano-env/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "basic-pitch[all]"
```

## Run the Backend (Flask)
```bash
python backend_server.py
```
Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Open the Frontend
Open `index.html` in your browser and upload an audio file. A download link for the converted MIDI file will appear after conversion.

## Folder Structure
```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ piano-env/           # Virtual environment (ignored by Git)
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/            # Uploaded audio files
â”œâ”€â”€ midi/               # Generated MIDI files
â”œâ”€â”€ backend_server.py   # Flask backend
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore          # Ignored files
```

## Troubleshooting
**Flask not installed:**
```bash
pip install flask
```

**"No file uploaded" error:**
Ensure you're selecting a valid audio file (like `.wav` or `.mp3`).

**Server not responding:**
Make sure Flask server is running and the frontend points to `http://localhost:8000`.
