The project involves the practical part of my final bachelor thesis, where I created a tool to help with learning to play the piano. The main objective of the project is to convert an audio file into a MIDI file. The goal is to build and train my own model (possibly inspired by the Transkun model) while also providing the option to use other existing models, like Spotifyâ€™s Basic Pitch.
